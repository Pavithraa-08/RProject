## A word of advice
Think of the SCEM labs as going to the gym: if you pay a gym membership, but instead of working out you use a machine to lift the weights for you, you won't get the benefits.

ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude and other GenAI tools can provide answers to most of the questions below. Before you try that, please consider the following: answering the specific questions below is not the point of this assignment. Instead, the questions are designed to give you the chance to develop a better understanding of estimation concepts and a certain level of _**statistical thinking**_. These are essential skills for any data scientist, even if they end up using generative AI - to write an effective prompt and to catch the common (often subtle) errors that AI produces when trying to solve anything non-trivial.

A very important part of this learning involves not having the answers ready-made for you, but instead taking the time to actually search for the answer, trying something, getting it wrong, and trying again.

So, make the best use of this session. The assignments are not marked, so it is much better to try the yourself even if you get incorrect answers (you'll be able to correct yourself later when you receive feedback) than to submit a perfect, but GPT'd solution.

## IMPORTANT NOTES: 
- **DO NOT** change the code block names. Enter your solutions to each question into the predefined code blocks. 
- **DO NOT** add calls to `install.packages()` into your solutions. Some questions may require you to load packages using `library()`. Please do not use any other packages except the ones explicitly listed in the "setup" code block. 

---

## Setup

This code block below sets up your session. The only think you should change in it is to replace `"ABCDEFG"` by your student ID number, which will be used as the seed for your random number generators.

```{r ID, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## We will use your student ID as the seed for the random number generator.
MY_STUDENT_ID <- 2757887 # <-- Replace "ABCDEFG" by your student ID number (as an integer, i.e., without quotes).
```

```{r Setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS CODE BLOCK

## Note: tidyverse includes:
## ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats, and lubridate.
## Check https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/ for details

allowed.packages <- c("tidyverse", "readxl")

for (i in seq_along(allowed.packages)){
  if(!(allowed.packages[i] %in% installed.packages()[, 1])){
    install.packages(allowed.packages[i])
  }
  library(allowed.packages[i], character.only = TRUE)
}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE)
ignore <- runif(1) # To initialise the PRNG
```
```{r checkID, echo=FALSE}
if(!is.numeric(MY_STUDENT_ID)){
  stop("MY_STUDENT_ID MUST BE YOUR VALID NUMERIC ID.")
} 
```
